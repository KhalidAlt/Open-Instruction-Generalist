# Open-Instruction-Generalist Assistant

Open Instruction Generalist (OIG) Assistant is an assistant that is part of the LAION-AI's OpenChat family of assistants.  OIG Assistant is trained on massive synthetic instructions with the goal of performing many millions of types of tasks. 

We will have several versions of the OIG Assistant ranging from an OIG Assistant that is trained on a small (less than 1M) high quality synthetic dataset, to an OIG Aisstant trained on medium quality but massive synthetic instructions. The research goal of OIG Assistant is to create high performing bots by using simple finetuning instead of RLHF.

We will create ever larger instruction datasets starting with 2M with the goal to generate eventually 1T medium quality instructions.
